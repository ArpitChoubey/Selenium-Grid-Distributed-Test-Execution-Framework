## 📌 What is Selenium Grid?

Selenium Grid is a powerful tool used to run automated test cases **in parallel** across multiple:

* Machines
* Browsers
* Operating systems

It drastically reduces the overall test execution time by distributing tests across different environments.

### ✔ Key Capabilities

* Parallel execution of automated tests
* Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
* Cross-platform testing (Windows, Mac, Linux)
* Supports multiple browser versions
* Speeds up regression suites for large automation frameworks

> **Safari** is supported only on **MacOS**.
> **Internet Explorer** is deprecated in modern Selenium versions.

## 🔢 Parallel Execution Formula

```
Total Execution Time = (Number of Tests × Average Test Time) / Number of Nodes
```

This helps estimate how many nodes are required for faster execution.

## 🧩 Selenium Grid Overview

Selenium Grid enables **distributed** and **parallel** test execution.
Useful for:

* Large-scale automation projects
* CI/CD pipelines
* Multi-browser validation
* Cloud & Docker-based executions

---

## 🛠 Selenium Grid Modes

### **1️⃣ Standalone Mode**

* Easiest setup
* Everything runs on a single machine
* Best for **local** and **small-scale** execution

### **2️⃣ Hub–Node Mode**

* Traditional Selenium Grid design
* One **Hub** manages multiple **Nodes**
* Great for distributed execution across machines

### **3️⃣ Fully Distributed Mode**

* Each Grid component runs separately (router, distributor, session map...)
* Highly scalable, microservice-style setup
* Ideal for enterprise-level parallelism

### **4️⃣ Docker Mode**

* Grid runs inside **Docker containers**
* Perfect for CI/CD, Jenkins, cloud pipelines, and Kubernetes clusters

## 🧱 Selenium Grid Components

### **Hub**

* The central controller
* Receives test requests
* Allocates tests to appropriate nodes

### **Node**

* A machine (local/remote/virtual) where tests run
* Can host multiple browser instances
* Nodes register themselves to the Hub
